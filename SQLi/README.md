# SQL INJECTION
### SQL INJECTION IS OF 3 MAIN TYPES:
* In-band SQLi: attacker uses the same communication channel to perform the attack and retrieve the results
* Blind/inferential SQLi: attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work, but rather simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database
* Out-of-band SQL injection: attacker uses different communication channels (such as database email functionality, or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results

### USES OF SQLi ATTACK
* Authentication and authorisation bypass
* Information disclosure
* data integrity compromise
* data availability compromise
* Remote Code execution (RCE)

## PERFORMING SQL INJECTION
we enter a malicious SQL query along with some characters to handle the syntax of the server's code.<br>
