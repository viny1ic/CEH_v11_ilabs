# ACTIVE SNIFFING

## MAC Flooding
MAC flooding is a technique used to compromise the security of network switches that connect network segments or network devices. Attackers use the MAC flooding technique to force a switch to act as a hub, so they can easily sniff the traffic.<br>
use the command ```macof -i <interface> -n <no of packets>```<br>

##DHCP starvation
In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCP requests and uses all available IP addresses that the DHCP server can issue. As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.<br>
