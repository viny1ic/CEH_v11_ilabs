# CRYPTOGRAPHY

## HASHING
Hash functions calculate a unique fixed-size bit string representation, called a message digest, of any arbitrary block of information. Message digest (One-way Hash) functions distill the information contained in a file (small or large) into a single fixed-length number. Given an input file and its corresponding message digest, it should be nearly impossible to find another file with the same message digest value, as it is computationally infeasible to have two files with the same message digest value. <br>
tools like HashCalc, HashMyFiles etc can be used to calculate hashes of text and files.

## FILE AND TEXT ENCRYPTION
Various data encryption tools such as CryptoForge and BCTextEncoder can be used to encrypt your files and messages to deliver and store them securely and the later decrypt them to extract the data.
